            <p>
                I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor of Science in Psychology and Statistics.
                Originally from Norfolk, Virginia, I moved to Arlington and have been working as a Pricing
                Analyst within the busy world of government contracting for the past 3 years. At my last position, I
                was lucky enough to have the opportunity to teach myself VBA in order to develop a custom, flexible
                pricing model for my company. I recognized I had a passion for programming and designing tools and
                interfaces. This allowed me to improve on my ability to quickly analyze data and lead meetings.
                Eventually, I realized that there was enormous potential to solving problems through code. I knew I
                wanted to focus on realizing this potential and that the first step would be to make a career change.
            </p>

            <p>
                I recently graduated from the Full Stack Flex Web Development coding bootcamp at George Washington
                University in order to pursue a future in web development.
                <br>
                While not coding or studying, I enjoy...
                <ul>
                    <li>singing and playing guitar</li>
                    <li>improving on my chess game</li>
                    <li>freelance consulting</li>
                    <li>making fanedits of various movies, namely Star Wars, to fix my head-canon</li>
                </ul>
